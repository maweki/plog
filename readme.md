# plog - Personal log
This can be used to keep a small record of what you did during the day.
Make sure to have git installed

## first start
* clone the repository
* add plog as an alias to your .bashrc `alias plog='~/plog/plog.py'`
* run `plog init` once or you break things (will be fixed soon)

## usage
* make sure to follow the 'first start'-manual
* type `plog` to check your log
* type `plog add your message...` to add a message to your personal log
